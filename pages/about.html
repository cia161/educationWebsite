                                <p>I'm Fatima, and I am excited to announce my candidacy for the Champaign Unit 4 School District Board of Education. I'm running because I believe in coming together to serve every student in our community.</p>
                                <p>As a biostatistician, a proud Illinois graduate, and a parent of three children who have attended Unit 4 schools, I bring professional expertise and personal experience to this role. Fun fact: the same teacher at Bottenfield who taught my husband later taught our eldest in kindergarten!</p>    
                                <p>I am passionate about creating a school board that represents all voices. My goal is to foster collaboration and respect among board members to make the best decisions for our students, families, and educators.</p>

                                <p>At the University of Illinois, I work with clients to analyze complex data, identify key trends, and provide evidence-based recommendations. This business experience will serve me well on the school board, as it also requires using data to guide decisions and policies. Additionally, my experience in creating budgets, managing projects, and ensuring compliance with regulations will help me oversee school district finances, assess educational initiatives, and make responsible, equitable decisions that prioritize student success. I am committed to using my business background to create transparency, accountability, and long-term improvements for our students.</p>
                                <p>My experience as a biostatistician has given me strong data-driven decision-making, strategic planning, and problem-solving skills that are highly relevant to serving on the school board. Just as I analyze data to find clear and reliable answers, I will take the same careful approach to decision-making, ensuring that our policies are based on facts, not assumptions. I also have experience explaining complex information to people from different backgrounds, which will help me communicate clearly with parents, teachers, and community members to build trust and transparency. Most importantly, I believe in continuous improvement and accountability. With major decisions ahead, we need board members like me who can understand data, think long-term, and make fair, responsible choices that put students first.</p>

I am committed to making sure resources are allocated equitably and effectively to support our students, teachers, and the community. My experience working with diverse groups and collaborating with clients to solve problems will allow me to work effectively with others on the board, and the administration, to improve communication, build trust, and create positive outcomes. I understand the importance of strong relationships between the school board, administration, and the community, and I am dedicated to fostering a transparent, inclusive environment where everyone has a voice and can work together for the betterment of our students.</p>
